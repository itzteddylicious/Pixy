        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h3>
            <p>
                Pixy was created with a vision to create an AI assistant which will help us in our daily needs. Pixy was created as a project for CS50's Introductory course on programming with Python and has become the aim to improve Pixy and make it into a very powerful AI which will not only help users with their need but will also work as their friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI has immense future opportunities and with Pixy we aim to provide the best virtual service assistant ever. Pixy is not just some project we did for just this course, it is just a base design for our journey towards a better Pixy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pixy currently is just a prototype and has just a handful of features. As we grow, we will bring more and more improved versions of Pixy which will blow your mind.
            </p>
